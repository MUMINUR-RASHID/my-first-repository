    <h1>About My Life</h1>
    <h3>My Childhood</h3>
    <p>I born in a middle class family in 1995, july 21. My father was an Electrical Engineer in Saiham Textile Mills Ltd. I am the youngest among my siblings. I have two elder brother and one elder sister. They love me very much.</p>
    <h3>My School Life</h3>
    <p>I started my school in january 12,1995. I was so happy about starting my school. Those time I thought school is nothing but a playground. But my thinking was proved wrong when I started  going to school. I was missed my mother in my class time. After a few days, I adopted myself with the environment. I continue my school till class VI. After clas six, my parents admited me in madrasa to make me hafez of Quran.</p>
    <h3>My Madrasa Life</h3>
    <p>Madrasa life is the best experience in my life. Till today, I think everybody should spend atleast his/her 3/4 years in madrasa to understad his/her life better.<br>By the way, I was admited in the class called Maktab, where Hujor taught us how to read the Quran properly. It was a nice process. If anybody ask me today, for a child suggest a technique to learn them something. I will suggest them this process undoubtly. After one year in Maktab, I admitted in Hefjkhana, where everybody memorise the Quran. I complete my memorising after 3 years. After that I re-admitted in school. </p>
    <h3>My New Journey</h3>
    <p>After madrasa, I admitted in class VIII in Syed Sayed Uddin High School And Collage. I lost my two academic years for this gambling. <br>
    By the way, my new school journey was full of adventure. In my first day of school, the person, who thought I was an inocent. In my last day of school they thought I was the one and only virus in their class.I enjoyed my school life very much. Rule's breaking, class miss, playing in class time, quarreling with girls were become my daily work. But my favourite was quarreling with girls. My teachers also loved me. They was very nice to me. One of them was Dilen Kumar paul, who is the best teacher in my life.<br> In 2015 I completed my school and admitted in collage.</p>
    <h3>My Collage Life</h3>
    <p>I was admitted in Ideal collage,Dhanmondi. My collage life was full of fustration. I was missed my school friends, my impish works, my teachers and also my qurrels. There was created a big distance with some of my best friends. I couldn't accept this. I felt lonely all the time. After some day I realise the reality. But it was too late. In themeanwhile there create a big gap in my study. Which I couldn't recover.  </p>
    <h3>My Fustration</h3>
    <p>I was fustrated on my H.S.C result. It was so bad that I couldn't accept. My passion was Engineering. But, for my result, I couldn't even apply in any Engineering Univercities. Then I admitted in UCC, which is known as univercity coaching center. But the coaching center was focused on teaching short cuts. Which impect badly in my preparetion. I didn't get chance to apply in any govt. univercities. I dropped another year for trying second time. Next year I admitted in UDVASH known as Enginnearing coaching center. This time I got chance in MBSTU,JUST,SEC. I apply in SEC to admit myself in CSE department which was my passion. And now, I am here to make my life better for future.  </p>

    Life is a playground. Here you can lose. You can Win. You can learn from your mistake. But it is not a single game, which depends on only one win or lose.
